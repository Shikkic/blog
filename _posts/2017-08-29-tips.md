### Preface

There are many ways to be effective when using a computer for work or hobby. In fact, there are so many nuanced ways that it can vary widely from program to program.

However, there is one abstraction that I believe governs a lot of the computer usage, things we all could all use, and that is effective **Window Management**. It's really easy for something that sounds as simple as navigating your computer's application windows to be overlooked.

I have one core philosphy that I hope to instill in you.

### The Philosphy

> Keep your hands off the mouse as much as possible.

Whenever you lift your hands off the keyboard, the source of most actionable interfaces on a computer, you lose a lot of time. You should never be wasting time using your mouse for things like:

- Resizing a window
- Closing a window
- Maximizing a window
- Anything do with window management

Now you might be thinking that's a bit much, but I urge you to give it a try. I'll be teaching you how to do all the above an more without having to take your hands off the keyboard. This allows for seamless transition from application to application, without losing context or time.

# Special Keys

First thing is first, mac's have some unique ways of mapping shapes to keys. We are going to be referencing them a lot so lets just address the ones you really need to know and visually represent them so you can easily remember them.

`⌘ ` - Command

`⌥` - Option/Alt

`⌃` - Control

`⇧` - Shift

`↑` - Up Arrow

`↓` - Down Arrow

`←` - Left Arrow

`→` - Right Arrow

Not so bad, but it can always be a little startling to look at something like `⌥`. Where that symbol comes from I'll never know.

One of the biggest usages of manually resizing windows and dragging them around is to make two windows equal size, side-by-side, or some variance of that.

We're going to learn how to streamline that process so it's lighting fast.

## What is a window manager?

A Window Manager is a program that allows you to send application windows to predetermined areas of the screen with keyboard shortcuts. For our purposes we're going identify three different types of screen placements where we can send windows.

- [Verticle Halves](#)
- [Horizontal Halves](#)
- [Quadrants](#)

You can actually mix and match these as you please, but we're going to look at them seperately.

**Verticle Halves**

The Verticle Halves placement is probably the most common. When you want to view things side by side, you have two distinct halves of the screen you can send windows too.

**Horizontal Halves**

The Horizontal Halves placement is almost identical to the Verticle Halves. When you want to stack windows horizontally you're given two distinct halves of the screen you can send windows too.

**Quadrants**

With the Quadrant placement we can utilize up to four windows at a time, all exactly the same dimensions. Each placement has a seperate shortcut that can send it to any of window slots 1 - 4.

## Introducing Spectacle

[Specticle](https://www.spectacleapp.com/) is a free and open sourced window manager used by lots of people today. It runs as a mac applications that sits in the nav bar.

**Installation Note:**

> Apple's OS X Accessibility Protocol makes Spectacle possible. This protocol allows assistive applications to drive the user interface of another application running in OS X. In order to do its job Spectacle must be granted access to use these accessibility features. Instructions to do so will be displayed if Spectacle determines it does not have sufficient privileges.

# Window Hotkeys

Sample text. What are we going to talk about? What are the basics you should know?

- [Lower the dock for more screen real-estate]()
- [Navigating Applications]()
  - [Moving Forward Through Open Applications]()
  - [Moving Backwards Through Open Applications]()
  - [Minimize and Maximize a window]()
  - [Create new window / applications]()
  - [Closing a window / application]()

## Lower the dock for more screen real-estate

If you're working on a laptop often, _especially_ if you're using a 13" screen, every inch of screen real-estate matters. There is no good reason to have your dock on display taking up two inches of precious useful screen real-estate! 

So let's hide it so we don't have to see it unless we hover over it.

`alt/option + ⌘ + D`

I *strongly* encourage if you still feel heistant to make the change, **do it**. After all, [it's free real estate!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd4-UnU8lWY)

## Navigating Applications

Something something you should never need to use a mouse to bring up and application, close it, or minimize it.

### Navigating Open Applications

Stuff explained here maybe a picture?

> insert picture

### Cycle Forward

`⌘ + tab` + let go when you want to stop.

> When you're hovering an application icon and want to stop simply let go.

</details>

### Cycle Backwards

Hit `⌘ + tab` to bring open the tab menu and quickly press ``` ` ``` to cycle backwards.

> When you're hovering an application icon and want to stop simply let go.

## Minimize and Maximize a window
	
You should _never_ have to click on an icon to bring the window up.

### Minimize

`⌘ + m`

> Make sure the window you want to minimize is in focus. You can cylce through your applications to double check.

### Maximize

`⌘ + ⌥`

> Make sure the window you want to maximize is in focus. You can cylce through your applications to double check.

## Create new window / applications

`⌘ + n`

## Closing a window / application

`⌘ + w`

## Quiting an application

Subtle difference.

`⌘ + q`

## Launch an application

`⌘ + space`

# Final tips

You don't have to do all of these things at once, it can be hard to learn or even remember to use them. I would say pick one or two that you really want to try and focus on just that. Leave a sticky not on your monitor!

## Investigate Application Specific Shortcuts

Stuff

> Maybe show case some slack shortcuts

## Don't try to over-shortcut your life

Stuff

## Re-mapping

If you're feeling particularly adventurous try re-mapping these 

Hope you enjoyed and learn something new.
