title: MacOS Workflows and Tips - Part 1 Window Management
excerpt: How do you classify how complex a problem is? Can it be solved within a discrete number of steps or is it so complicated the answer can't be expressed as an equation or mathematical expression. Maybe the two are really the same under the hood.

### Purpose of this article

> I want you to become more effective in your workflows, that means that you'll need to 

> Something as simple as navigating your computer can often be over looked.

> Includes visual examples

<h3 id="my-philosphy" href="#my-philosphy">My Philosphy</h3>

> Keep your hands OFF the mouse

This very much depends on the _kind_ of work that you do. I will be talking specifically in the context of Software Development but I feel this could be broadly applied to many fields of work that use a computer.

# Special Keys Visually Mapping

I hate macOS keyboard symbols for things like:

`⌥`

`⌃`

`↑`

`⇧`

WHAT EVEN IS THIS `⌥` I FORGET EVERYTIME.

# Window Management

What's the problem here?

- Manually having to resize windows to see multiple applications at the same time

> Create picture showing diagram of screen real estate

## What's a window manager?

- What's a window manager

A good free open source solution to use [Shift It](https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt).

# Window Hotkeys

Sample text. What are we going to talk about? What are the basics you should know?

- [Lower the dock for more screen real-estate]()
- [Navigating Applications]()
  - [Moving Forward Through Open Applications]()
  - [Moving Backwards Through Open Applications]()
  - [Minimize and Maximize a window]()
  - [Create new window / applications]()
  - [Closing a window / application]()

## Lower the dock for more screen real-estate

If you're working on a laptop often, _especially_ if you're using a 13" screen, every inch of screen real-estate matters. There is no good reason to have your dock on display taking up two inches of precious useful screen real-estate! 

So let's hide it so we don't have to see it unless we hover over it.

`alt/option + ⌘ + D`

I *strongly* encourage if you still feel heistant to make the change, **do it**. After all, [it's free real estate!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd4-UnU8lWY)

## Navigating Applications

Something something you should never need to use a mouse to bring up and application, close it, or minimize it.

### Navigating Open Applications

Stuff explained here maybe a picture?

> insert picture

### Cycle Forward

`⌘ + tab` + let go when you want to stop.

> When you're hovering an application icon and want to stop simply let go.

  <summary>Visual example (click me)</summary>

</details>

### Cycle Backwards

Hit `⌘ + tab` to bring open the tab menu and quickly press ``` ` ``` to cycle backwards.

> When you're hovering an application icon and want to stop simply let go.

  <summary>Visual example (click me)</summary>

</details>

## Minimize and Maximize a window
	
You should _never_ have to click on an icon to bring the window up.

### Minimize

`⌘ + m`

> Make sure the window you want to minimize is in focus. You can cylce through your applications to double check.

### Maximize

`⌘ + ⌥`

> Make sure the window you want to maximize is in focus. You can cylce through your applications to double check.

## Create new window / applications

`⌘ + n`

## Closing a window / application

`⌘ + w`

## Quiting an application

Subtle difference.

`⌘ + q`

## Launch an application

`⌘ + space`

# Final tips

You don't have to do all of these things at once, it can be hard to learn or even remember to use them. I would say pick one or two that you really want to try and focus on just that. Leave a sticky not on your monitor!

## Investigate Application Specific Shortcuts

Stuff

> Maybe show case some slack shortcuts

## Don't try to over-shortcut your life

Stuff

## Re-mapping

If you're feeling particularly adventurous try re-mapping these 

Hope you enjoyed and learn something new.
