### Preface

There are many ways to be effective when using a computer for work or hobby. Infact, there are so many nuaiced ways that can vary from program to program.

However, there is one abstraction that I believe governs a lot of the computer usage, things we all should know, and that is effective **Window Management**. It's really easy for something that sounds as simple as navigating your computer's application windows to be missed.

I have one core philosphy that I follow and hope to instill in you.

### The Philosphy

> Keep your hands off the mouse as my as possible.

Whenever you lift your hands off the keyboard, the source of most actionable interfaces on a computer, you lose a lot of time. You should never be wasting time using your mouse for things like:

- Resizing a window
- Closing a window
- Maximizing a window
- Anything do with window management

Now you might be thinking that's a bit much, but I urge you to give it a try. I'll be teaching you how to do all the above an more without having to take your hands off the keyboard. This allows for seamless transition from application to application, without losing context or time.

# Special Keys

First thing is first, mac's have some funky ways of mapping shapes to keys. We are going to be referencing them so lets just address the ones you really need to know and map them to names you can easily remember.

`⌘ ` - Command

`⌥` - Option/Alt

`⌃` - Control

`⇧` - Shift

`↑` - Up Arrow

`↓` - Down Arrow

`←` - Left Arrow

`→` - Right Arrow

Not so bad, but it can always be a little startling to look at something like `⌥`. Where that symbol comes from I'll never know.

# Window Management

One of the biggest usages of manually resizing windows and dragging them around is to make two windows equal size, side-by-side, or some variance of that.

We're going to learn how to streamline that process so it's lighting fast.

## What's a window manager?

A Window Manager sloves that problem for us by allowing laying out the screen into quadrents, and giving shortcuts to throw windows into specificed quadrants.

**Four Quadrants**

A good free open source solution to use [Shift It](https://github.com/fikovnik/ShiftIt).

# Window Hotkeys

Sample text. What are we going to talk about? What are the basics you should know?

- [Lower the dock for more screen real-estate]()
- [Navigating Applications]()
  - [Moving Forward Through Open Applications]()
  - [Moving Backwards Through Open Applications]()
  - [Minimize and Maximize a window]()
  - [Create new window / applications]()
  - [Closing a window / application]()

## Lower the dock for more screen real-estate

If you're working on a laptop often, _especially_ if you're using a 13" screen, every inch of screen real-estate matters. There is no good reason to have your dock on display taking up two inches of precious useful screen real-estate! 

So let's hide it so we don't have to see it unless we hover over it.

`alt/option + ⌘ + D`

I *strongly* encourage if you still feel heistant to make the change, **do it**. After all, [it's free real estate!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cd4-UnU8lWY)

## Navigating Applications

Something something you should never need to use a mouse to bring up and application, close it, or minimize it.

### Navigating Open Applications

Stuff explained here maybe a picture?

> insert picture

### Cycle Forward

`⌘ + tab` + let go when you want to stop.

> When you're hovering an application icon and want to stop simply let go.

### Cycle Backwards

Hit `⌘ + tab` to bring open the tab menu and quickly press ``` ` ``` to cycle backwards.

> When you're hovering an application icon and want to stop simply let go.

## Minimize and Maximize a window
	
You should _never_ have to click on an icon to bring the window up.

### Minimize

`⌘ + m`

> Make sure the window you want to minimize is in focus. You can cylce through your applications to double check.

### Maximize

`⌘ + ⌥`

> Make sure the window you want to maximize is in focus. You can cylce through your applications to double check.

## Create new window / applications

`⌘ + n`

## Closing a window / application

`⌘ + w`

## Quiting an application

Subtle difference.

`⌘ + q`

## Launch an application

`⌘ + space`

# Final tips

You don't have to do all of these things at once, it can be hard to learn or even remember to use them. I would say pick one or two that you really want to try and focus on just that. Leave a sticky not on your monitor!

## Investigate Application Specific Shortcuts

Stuff

> Maybe show case some slack shortcuts

## Don't try to over-shortcut your life

Stuff

## Re-mapping

If you're feeling particularly adventurous try re-mapping these 

Hope you enjoyed and learn something new.
